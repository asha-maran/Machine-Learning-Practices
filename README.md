Learning Processes


As an incoming college student, I had no experience in Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence, two things I was very interested in learning more about. 

After beginning research through Link Laboratory at the University of Virginia, I was pointed towards different resources to teach myself how to properly create a Neural Net and teach a computer how to 'learn' to perform a certain task. Thus, this repository is for me to keep my completed tutorials as I further my understanding of Deep Learning.
